To run the tests ensure the server is up the the port 5000 (or change the variable `mathSolverBasePath` in the file `index.js`):

If you want to reduce the tests that are going to be runned, modify the variables `theoremesToTest`, `functionsToTest` in the file `index.js`

Then execute:
`npm install`
`node index.js`

or

`node index.js --color=always 2>&1 | tee test-result-file`
